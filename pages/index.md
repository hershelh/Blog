Hi, My name is Hershel Hahn. I am a student and front-end developer.

I have been learning front-end for over 2 years and my most used frameworks/libraries are Vue, Vite, Vitest, etc. I am very interested in the ecosystem of Vue/Vite and am trying to contribute to them and their community. But I am still in the early stages of the open source world and haven't delved into it yet. But I am doing my best to learn more and become familiar with the whole community.

I am currently preparing to find an internship, which is a painful process, but it is also a summary of my knowledge system. After that, I will have more time to learn things I am interested in, such as Rust, Nuxt, etc.

Life is hard, but we can have fun with it.

You can contact me through hershelhahn@outlook.com.
